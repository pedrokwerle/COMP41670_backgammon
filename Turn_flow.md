Certainly! In a game of backgammon, the flow of events during a player's turn typically involves several steps. Here's a basic outline:

1. **Rolling the Dice:** The player rolls two six-sided dice. Each die corresponds to a separate move. For example, if the roll is a 4 and a 2, the player can move one checker four spaces and another checker two spaces, or vice versa.

2. **Check for Legality:** After rolling the dice, the player must determine if the moves indicated by the dice are legal. This involves checking if the proposed moves adhere to the rules of the game, including:
    - Moving to an open point (a space with one or no opponent's checkers) or a point occupied by their own checkers.
    - The sum of the dice must be used if possible. If one move is possible, but not both, the player must make the higher move.
    - Bar checkers need to be re-entered into the opponent's home board before other moves can be made.

3. **Executing Moves:** Once the legal moves are identified, the player moves their checkers accordingly. They can choose to move one checker the total of both dice or two checkers separately based on each die.

4. **Hitting Opponent's Checker:** If a player lands on a single opposing checker on a point, the opponent's checker is "hit" and moved to the bar. The opponent needs to re-enter that checker before making any other moves.

5. **Bearing Off:** As a player moves their checkers towards their home board, they eventually reach a point where they can bear them off the board. This can only happen when all the player's checkers are in their home board. The numbers rolled on the dice must correspond exactly to the point where a checker is situated in order to bear it off.

6. **Ending the Turn:** After making all the possible moves based on the dice roll, the turn ends, and it's the opponent's turn to roll the dice and repeat the process.

Remember, there are nuances in the game based on specific situations, such as having a checker on the bar or certain strategic considerations. Players can use strategy and tactics to optimize their moves within the constraints of the dice rolls.

This flow represents a basic sequence of events in a turn of backgammon, but the actual gameplay might vary based on the players' strategies and the specific circumstances during the game.
